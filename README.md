## What's New in v1.2 — Depth & Content Update

v1.2 is the most substantial content update yet — focused on delivering meaningful learning depth across all five layers while keeping engagement high. Total learning time nearly triples from v1.1.

---

### 📚 Deepened Foundation Modules (Layer 1)

All four Layer 1 modules received significant content additions:

**Each foundation module now includes:**
- 2–3 additional lesson cards exploring the topic from different angles
- A second quiz question reinforcing key concepts
- A **"Real Talk" card** — a direct, conversational callout connecting the lesson to gig worker / shared apartment life specifically

**New content highlights:**
- *Why It's So Hard to Stop Overspending* — explains present bias and invisible spending psychology
- *Timing Matters as Much as Amount* — committed money vs available money framework for gig income
- *The Subscription Audit* — the 30-day rule and how to reclaim $30–50/month
- *Two Payoff Strategies That Work* — Avalanche vs Snowball methods explained and compared
- Real Talk cards covering gig vehicle costs, shared apartment debit tracking, credit card balance creep, and the psychological challenge of irregular income

---

### 🧮 New Module: Monthly Budget Builder (Layer 2)

An interactive budget calculator that lets users enter their income and all expense categories and see in real time:
- Total income vs total expenses
- Monthly surplus or deficit
- Color-coded feedback (green = surplus, amber = break-even, red = deficit)
- Specific advice based on their situation

No data is saved. All calculations are local and immediate.

---

### 🏠 Two New Deep Concept Modules (Layer 3)

**Fixed vs Variable Expenses**
- Explains the critical difference between locked-in and controllable costs
- The 60% rule: fixed expenses should stay below 60% of baseline income
- Real Talk: how to calculate your own fixed expense ratio and what to do if it's too high

**The Real Cost of Your Apartment**
- Full breakdown of true housing costs beyond rent (utilities, internet, renters insurance, supplies)
- Three approaches to splitting costs with a partner (50/50, proportional, divided responsibility)
- Real Talk: how vague shared expense agreements cause conflict and how to prevent it
- Quiz: calculates the real monthly housing cost from component parts

---

### 🎲 Doubled Scenarios — 8 Total (Layer 4)

Layer 4 now has two modules (Part 1 and Part 2) with 4 scenarios each:

**Part 1 (original 3 + 1 new):**
1. Best delivery week ever — what do you do with the money?
2. Slow week emergency — phone bill timing crunch
3. Apartment upgrade decision — can you really afford it?
4. *(New)* Subscription cancellation — where does the freed money go?

**Part 2 (all new):**
5. Car maintenance vs rent timing — your car is your income source
6. Lending money to a friend when you can't afford it
7. Surplus money decision — debt vs savings when you have both problems
8. Joint account proposal from your girlfriend — honest conversation vs agreement under pressure

Each scenario includes nuanced feedback for best, good, and poor choices — explaining not just what's right but *why*, including the long-term consequences of each path.

---

### 🪞 Expanded Reflection Check-In (Layer 5)

Monthly check-in expanded from 3 to 6 questions:
1. Did you spend less than you earned?
2. Did you avoid overdrafting?
3. Did you pay more than the minimum on your credit card?
4. *(New)* Did you cancel or avoid at least one unnecessary expense?
5. *(New)* Did you add anything to savings?
6. *(New)* Do you feel more in control than last month?

Each question now has more detailed, specific response text for both yes and no answers. Question 6 (feeling of control) tracks the most important long-term outcome — growing financial confidence.

---

### 💡 New Quick Tips (10 total)

Two new tips added:
- *Keep fixed expenses under 60% of income* — the margin safety rule
- *Talk about money before it becomes a problem* — couples and shared finances

---

### 🏅 Expanded Badge System (12 badges)

Three new badges added:
- 🏠 **Home Aware** — complete The Real Cost of Your Apartment
- 🎲 **Scenario Pro** — complete What Would You Do? Part 2
- 💰 **Budget Builder** — complete Monthly Budget Builder
